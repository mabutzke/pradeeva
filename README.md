WordPress Theme

Created this theme for my friend Pradeep Mahadeshwar. The theme is currently live at https://pradeepvisualartist.com.

It is built using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and PHP. The theme can be personalized from the admin panel, the 'customizer' from WordPress was implemented to change on the fly things like colors, font family, font sizes, margins and carousel images on the homepage.
